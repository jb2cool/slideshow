#Installation instructions for running Raspberry Pi slideshow

#Install latest Raspbian OS to SD card and boot Pi

#Run through initial Raspi-Config and then boot into GUI

#Update repositry info and upgrade packages to latest versions
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

#Install following applications;

#Matchbox window manager - Light weight window manager
sudo apt-get install matchbox

#rsync - File synchronisation application
sudo apt-get install rsync

#LibreOffice - Office suite including presentation application
sudo apt-get install libreoffice

#USBmount - Mounts usb stick automatically
sudo apt-get install usbmount

#Fix some issues that crept up when Devin moved to the Stretch release
sudo sed -i 's/MountFlags=slave/MountFlags=shared/g' /lib/systemd/system/systemd-udevd.service

#Reboot (to apply new mount settings)
sudo reboot

#Copy .xsession to /home/pi - assuming this is the user id setup to run on bootup
#This script starts the display manager and syncs the default user home with a fresh copy from /media/usb/pi
#It also deletes any previous LibreOffice config allowing clean start of slideshow
wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/jb2cool/slideshow/master/.xsession

#Insert the USB transfer stick (should be the label usb or you'll need to change some stuff)

#Create a copy of the default user (pi) in /media/usb
sudo cp -r /home/pi /media/usb/
cd /media/usb/pi/
sudo chmod -R a+r .
sudo chmod a+x .xsession

#Create a slideshow named slideshow.ppt and copy to /media/usb/pi - This will autostart on bootup
#To update the slideshow simply replace the version on the USB stick and reboot withthe USB stick plugged in (USB stick is only needed if you want to update the presentation, without the USB stick it'll just play the last know presentation)
#Restart the Raspberry Pi, stand back and enjoy your show 

#Thanks to Peter Milne for supplying the original code. I have only adjusted his work for my own use
